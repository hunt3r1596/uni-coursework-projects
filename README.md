# MSc AI Coursework Projects

This repository contains the coursework projects for the MSc AI program. The projects are completed as part of the following modules:

## 1. [Autonomous Vehicle Navigation](https://github.com/hunt3r1596/autonomous-vehicle-navigation-ras-cw-project) (Robotics and Autonomous Systems)

The Autonomous Vehicle Navigation project focuses on developing a solution for autonomous navigation of a vehicle in a simulated environment (webots). The project explores various concepts and techniques in robotics and autonomous systems. It involves tasks such as sensor integration, perception, motion planning, and control. The project aims to enhance the understanding of autonomous vehicle navigation and its practical applications.

## 2. [Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/hunt3r1596/diabetes-prediction-ml-cw-project) (Machine Learning)

The Diabetes Prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on certain features such as age, BMI, glucose level, etc. The project explores different machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation methods. It aims to enhance the knowledge and skills in applying machine learning techniques to healthcare data and predictive modeling.

## 3. [Linear B-cell Epitome Prediction](https://github.com/hunt3r1596/b-cell-epitope-prediction-dm-cw-project) (Data Mining)

The Linear B-cell Epitome Prediction project focuses on predicting linear B-cell epitopes in protein sequences. It involves analyzing protein sequence data, feature engineering, and applying data mining techniques to develop a predictive model. The project aims to gain insights into data mining algorithms, feature selection methods, and model evaluation techniques specific to the prediction of linear B-cell epitomes.

Each project in this repository has its own dedicated folder containing the necessary code, datasets, and documentation related to the project. Please refer to the individual project folders for more detailed information on each project.

Please note that the projects are intended for educational purposes and serve as demonstrations of the skills and knowledge acquired during the MSc AI coursework.
